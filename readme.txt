This wordpress plugin enables you to have a dynamic sidebar in a way that you can post automatically in there. By this plugin you can add and remove your widgets automatically. You set your Start Date and End Date in the plugin and everything will be done for you!
For instance you want to insert a banner or advertisement for the coming new year but you can not do it just at the exact coming new year time! So whenever you have time you can set a future Start Date and an End Date in this plugin and everything is just done with that! The plugin itself inserts your banner at the given Start Date and End Date.
For another example you can make a deadline for your banner by just giving an End Date in the plugin and the banner starts but will be removed on the End Date automatically.

There are three different ways:

1) Manually

It is just like HTML Text Widget but you can use Twitter Bootstrap Classes, access to Media Library and insert links and images easily and quickly.

2) Automatically

Rather than all of the features in "Manually" you can set a Start Date and an End Date for your widget so your widget will be shown on your website at your Start Date that you have just set and will be removed at End Date that you have just set.
NOTE: If you want to use this type you must have another active widget ( with any type ) in your sidebar.

3) Deadline

Beside all of the features in "Manually" type, there is an End Date that you can set and when you active this type of widget it will be shown in your sidebar and whenever it reaches to its End Date it will be removed from your website automatically.

Automatic Widgets Meta Box ( in WordPress Dashboard menu )

Here you can view all of your "automatically and deadline" widget types. You can see when they are started or ended. For instance you can see which "automatically" types are going to be started or which "deadline" types are going to be removed form your sidebar. It is actually your statistics of automatic widgets.

We hope you like it, thank you very much indeed.
